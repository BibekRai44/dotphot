He was totally in love, thinking only about that girl all day, everytime. We used to wait for the bus in the stand and the girl used wait for the bus with us. He used to catch her glimpse     But it was unfortunate that the girl he liked was not so obssesed about him like he was for her. Bibek was so obssesed that he could not wait to express his feeling to her. He was of course in little hurry. He gathered some confidence and one day he did it anyway. She was kind of not convinced as all girls are like because everything happened in a blink.</p>
<p>His heart broke into pieces. He used to come to college and sit in the corner quite and sad .The whole class was not happy for what happened with Bibek.-->One day we all boys were having some discussion in a break. The discussion was all about everyone&rsquo;s break up and life lessons to convince him not to be tensed and depressed. Everyone had a different story, some were funny, some were useless and some were made up stories. After listening to all story stuffs one came up with an idea of going for one-day tour to a very different place. We all were like- Not a bad idea. A different place carries a different vibes. So it was not a planned trip but out of sadness we all agreed going somewhere far from where we were. We decided to go Dharan, to the top hills- peaceful and fresh. We planned to meet at the junction the next morning.</p>
<p>The very next day, we the seven boys bunked the class, we had Guitar, bag packed up with underwears and a packet of ciggeretes.
We took a bus and started our trip to Dharan.</p>

<p>Dharan is beautiful place cool, clean, well managed with high hills and water streams. The weather that day was supporting too. It was cloudy, cool day with low sun beams. After we reached Dharan the first thing the boys were doing was roaming everwhere around searching for ciggeretes. Bebek knew that it was foolish to expect help from the boys. We decided to head towards religious areas as God could only help him. We headed towards Dantakali temple. It is one of the holy places in Dharan, &ldquo;Danta&rdquo; meaning tooth- it is believed that when the goddess Sati, the first wife of the God Mahadev gave up her life it was distributed into pieces, one of the pieces which was the tooth part fell into that area so it was called Dantakali.We prayed there. We then headed to the viewpoint, we sat there sang beautiful song watching the view from the top point.</p>
