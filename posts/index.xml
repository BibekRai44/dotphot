The discussion was all about everyone&amp;rsquo;s break up and life lessons.Everyone had a different story, some were funny, some were useless and some were made up stories. After listening to all story stuffs one came up with an idea of going for one-day tour to a very different place. We all were like- Not a bad idea.</description>

      <description>Extreme Biratnagar heat and crowd was exhausting us on daily basis. Me and some of my friends were discussing on discord of going out of city for a day on a nearest fun place to visit. We ended up going to Barju Taal which is like 13-14 km away from Birtangar. At that time, we were giving 3rd semester exam and as soon as our exam got ended , we fixed this travel.</description>
