Me and some of my friends were discussing on discord of going out of city for a day on a nearest fun place to visit. We ended up going to Barju Taal which is like 13-14 km away from Birtangar. At that time, we were giving 3rd semester exam and as soon as our exam got ended , we fixed this travel. On our travel day , there was strike throughout the nation( on which matter I forget ðŸ˜„) so we decided to travel walking(also we do not have any personal vechile cause are broke af ðŸ˜ž). We(Bibek Rai, Kishor Pokharel and Sagar Mani Pokharel) meet up at Bargachi,Biratnagar and we headed on the destination.</p>
