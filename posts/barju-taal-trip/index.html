Me and some of my friends were discussing on discord of going out of city for a day on a nearest fun place to visit. We ended up going to Barju Taal which is like 13-14 km away from Birtangar. At that time, we were giving 3rd semester exam and as soon as our exam got ended , we fixed this travel. On our travel day , there was strike throughout the nation( on which matter I forget ðŸ˜„) so we decided to travel walking(also we do not have any personal vechile cause are broke af ðŸ˜ž). We(Bibek Rai, Kishor Pokharel and Sagar Mani Pokharel) meet up at Bargachi,Biratnagar and we headed on the destination.</p>

<p>The weather was fine for us to travel. We bought some light snacks on our way. We discussed different aspects of life,culture,habit and other unnecessary talk while travelling ðŸ˜‚.</p>

<p>After like 2 and half hours , we arrived at barju taal entrance point where we paid like Rs 40 or 50 per head (I don&rsquo;t actually remember).</p>

<p>We wandared the place for a bit and chill. Also we three of us did boating. It cost total Rs 200 for us. I already had experience of boating but other two my friend was new to it. I think they enjoyed this ðŸ¤¨. There was small park to play
especially for children inside the barju taal compound. We tried to enter there but we got denied and also it cost charge ðŸ˜‚.</p>
<p>I would share the photos and videos taken inside as I have nothing left to write ðŸ˜‰.
<strong>Look and Enjoy</strong></p>

<p>After we finished exploring , we returned. Despite of strike , there was vechile running in small amount. But it was hard for us to get bus,jeep etc. We also asked for lift for returing back but none offered us . Then, we decided to walk again 13-14 km again. We were already exhausted then this walk again makes us more exhaust. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£</p>

<p>We finally reached bargachi after walking 2 hours straight and splitted and headed to our respective destination.</p>
