      <description>Nothing compares to the thrill of hopping on a motorcycle with a group of adventurous friends and venturing into the unknown. It&amp;rsquo;s a recipe for unforgettable memories. And that&amp;rsquo;s precisely what awaited us as we set off on a remarkable 234 kilometer trip to the hilly region of Bhojpur, and back.
Our plan was simple: to traverse the winding roads to finally reach Temke Dada and admire the view of 8 different mountain peaks.</description>

      <description>Extreme Biratnagar heat and crowd was exhausting us on daily basis. Me and some of my friends were discussing on discord of going out of city for a day on a nearest fun place to visit. We ended up going to Barju Taal which is like 13-14 km away from Birtangar. At that time, we were giving 3rd semester exam and as soon as our exam got ended , we fixed this travel.</description>
